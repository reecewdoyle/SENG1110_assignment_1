## Design and Planning

_Describe your initial plan for how the system would be structured. How did you decide on the use of three classes? How did you handle the differences between small, medium, and large projects? Were there any changes made after starting the implementation?_

---

## Development Process

_Explain how you built the system from the ground up. Describe what features you worked on first, what order you tackled the requirements in, and why. Mention how you approached writing methods like createProject, addTask, or markTaskAsCompleted._

---

## Time Tracking

_Provide an honest overview of how long you spent on various parts of the assignment – e.g., planning, writing code, testing, documentation, screenshots, debugging._

---

## Errors and Debugging

_Reflect on the kinds of bugs you encountered. Did they come from poor design decisions? Typos? Logic errors? Which ones were hardest to find?_

---

## Object-Oriented Class Relationships

_Explain the structure between Task, Project, and UserInterface. Talk about how UserInterface manages the program, how Project holds Tasks, and how these classes interact without using advanced OOP features._

---

## Program Screenshots

_Include images showing key program features. You can add each image below a heading such as:_

### Creating a Project  
_(Insert screenshot and brief caption)_

### Adding and Completing Tasks  
_(Insert screenshot and caption)_

### Filtering by Task Type  
_(Insert screenshot and caption)_

### Project Summary Report  
_(Insert screenshot and caption)_

## Use of Disallowed Topics

_If you didn’t use anything outside Weeks 1–7, just say so clearly:_

> No disallowed topics were used in this program. All implementation was completed using techniques from Weeks 1–7 only.
